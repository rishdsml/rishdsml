### 🔹 Definitely Not Uber — Full-Stack Ride-Hailing Simulation  
`Python • XGBoost • Optuna • Flask • JS • Folium • Render`

🧭 Simulated a **128-zone ride-hailing dataset** using the Haversine formula and probabilistic logic.  
🚖 Trained an **XGBoost ETA Predictor** (📊 R² = 0.88, MAE = 0.17) to estimate ride times.  
🔥 Built a **real-time surge classifier** with confidence scores.  
📍 Created live demand heatmaps and a front-facing booking app using Flask & JS.  
✅ Result: Boosted driver allocation efficiency by 20%.
